## Tavern
Tavern aims to be a web platform for DMs to host single-player campaigns. The main goal is to allow DMs to create dungeons, towns, NPCs etc., and collate them for re-use with other players.

The intent is to be a tool both to play text-based RPGs online with your friends, and to help DMs flesh out the worlds they create.
